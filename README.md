            The code of this repository was written during a <a href="https://marmelab.com/blog/2018/09/05/agile-integration.html">Marmelab agile integration</a>. It illustrates the efforts of a new hiree, who had to implement a board game in several languages and platforms as part of his initial learning. Some of these efforts end up in failure, but failure is part of our learning process, so the code remains publicly visible.<br />
        <strong>This code is not intended to be used in production, and is not maintained.</strong>
